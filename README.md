## Identify Problems
### CURRENT WEBSITE
- website is not mobile-friendly
  - navigation disappears
  - Wix does not allow for changing templates easily (removes all content)
  - https://support.wix.com/en/article/request-responsive-sites 
  - https://www.editorx.com/ 
- restructure navigation 
  - contact page exists but is buried
  - inaccessible to mobile users
- newsletters sent out regularly but there is no signup form 
  - https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-and-setting-up-a-get-subscribers-form 

### LIVE CHAT 
- chat box integrated but client has to login on desktop to access
  - Mobile app exists, but likely does not know it’s available or has been unable to download it
    - https://www.wix.com/app-market/wix-chat  (primary info)
    - https://apps.apple.com/app/wix/id1099748482  (iOS app)
    - https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-chat  (more info)
  - asks user for name and email address to be contacted 
    - this is not necessarily a bad setup as long as it works as expected
  - does not display “chat hours” to user, but the setting is available to setup
